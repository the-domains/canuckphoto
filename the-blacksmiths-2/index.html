I was very interested and asked her if she could arrange for me to meet and photograph one of them. She ended up introducing me to a man named Lloyd Johnston, who has this incredible resume as a blacksmith, including being the person responsible for the historically accurate restoration of the iron gates on Canada’s Parliament Buildings.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/63ff9be87d24128193bbb580a164f21ef8651ef4.jpg" alt="Copyright &copy; Dan Bannister" title=""><p>In most places, especially in North America, if you want (for example) a beautiful, well-made coat rack for your home, you’ll have a hard time finding one that’s not mass produced in a developing country and frankly, it won’t likely be something that you’ll be proud to own in 10 years time. The idea of finding a local craftsperson to custom make one for you is a bit foreign now but, at one time, people like blacksmiths were a staple of a local economy and you could go to them, have something made specifically for you and it would last a lifetime or longer. Now, for the most part, we seek out the cheapest solution and toss it away when it falls apart or goes out of style in a year or two.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ab24fa0e8deb5d664bf967933f6abcd53fc0c000.jpg" alt="Copyright &copy; Dan Bannister" title=""><p>I originally thought I’d render the images in black and white, and I actually have some large prints in my home of these images as black and whites (which I love), but, in terms of presenting them more publicly, I decided that showing the trade of blacksmithing in black and white would be too “old fashioned” and might prevent it’s wider appeal so, I decided to process and present the project with a more modern treatment that still accentuates the work and draws attention to the products they are making.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8847d8c7dfd5457a3e7791373976d8f6b12ec08a.jpg" alt="Copyright &copy; Dan Bannister" title=""><p>The project was shot in a somewhat simple fashion as many of the locations were somewhat limited for space. As well, I didn’t want the subjects to be intimidated by setting up a lot of large complex lighting like I might for a commercial shoot so, I kept it simple by using one beauty dish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f81f63a2939c2f7ce92e098e7cb9f958e9cbe6f6.jpg" alt="Copyright &copy; Dan Bannister" title=""><p>I also made a short video documentary in the shop of one Blacksmith which you can see on <a href="https://vimeo.com/129811628">Vimeo</a>.</p><p><i>About the author: Dan Bannister is a commercial photographer and director based in Toronto, Canada.
