# Yet another test post with more than one picture

Please excuse the mess... we're testing [The Grid][0] and it's still in beta. So this site full of problems. ![Showroom Caption](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ef0a5292-2617-4c37-bc09-dc66ba05f30a.jpg)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse nec ante nec turpis laoreet mollis. Mauris sed dapibus eros. Fusce porta leo a ante laoreet rutrum. Suspendisse potenti. Quisque ultrices, est eu facilisis vulputate, risus ex imperdiet velit, sed aliquam eros arcu in ex. Sed blandit facilisis interdum.

Why is the picture below cropped when I unchecked the "crop" checkbox? And why won't this paragraph show up in the published post?
