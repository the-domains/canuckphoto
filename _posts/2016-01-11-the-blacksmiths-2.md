# The Blacksmiths 2

### A personal photography project about blacksmiths and their craft.

My name is Dan Bannister and I'm a commercial photographer based in Toronto, Canada. My day to day photography work is mostly advertising and fashion for retail brands but I like to add variety to my photography and exercise my creative muscles by pursuing personal projects alongside my commercial work as much as I can.

I've always been keenly aware of the trend of "offshoring" and globalization in general. Manufacturing, especially small craft manufacturers and local business, have been disappearing at an alarming rate over the past 10 years. In general, it seems like it's getting harder and harder to find locally made products as companies send their manufacturing offshore to lower prices but, in the long term, this is at the cost of local jobs and trades like blacksmithing.
