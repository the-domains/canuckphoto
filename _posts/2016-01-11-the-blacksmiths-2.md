# The Blacksmiths 2

### A personal photography project about blacksmiths and their craft.

My name is Dan Bannister and I'm a commercial photographer based in Toronto, Canada. My day to day photography work is mostly advertising and fashion for retail brands but I like to add variety to my photography and exercise my creative muscles by pursuing personal projects alongside my commercial work as much as I can.
