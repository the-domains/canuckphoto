# This Montreal Photographer Clicked Beautiful Pictures Of His Camera Shy Girlfriend

## Why is there no picture on the home page for this post? This paragraph is h2\.

Montreal-based photographer, MikaÃ«l Theimer, wanted to take pictures of his beautiful girlfriend Marion, but she refused to pose for him. So he decided instead to document all the different ways the camera shy Marion tried to dodge his camera.

"She hates to pose, and she hates to be in front of the camera. So this became a little game that we have. Whenever I see a scene I would love to photograph her in, she has to find a way to hide her face. I find it results in much more interesting pictures than just traditional portraits."

Check out the results below!

Why are the first and last photos published at actual pixel dimensions, but the rest are enlarged? Why is the vertical picture below cropped to horizontal format, when I have unchecked "crop" in the image details?

The picture is also cropped and it shouldn't be.
