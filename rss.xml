            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>THE HASSELBLAD H5D 50C WIFI VS. THE PHASE ONE XF IQ350</h1><p>Before purchasing the Hasselblad H5D 50c WiFi last December, I did a ton of research and tried out both the H5D 50c WiFi and the Phase One XF/IQ350 camera systems before making any decisions. I realize there are a very small number of people out there that shoot with either of these systems or even care about a comparison of these two cameras. But, for those that do, here I will offer up my thoughts on these two state of the art camera systems.
