            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Matt Barnes is up Schitt’s Creek.  Again.</h1><p>Toronto photographer Matt Barnes has once again found himself up Schitt’s Creek.  No paddles necessary!  Matt was thrilled to be approached by The Young Astronauts (very rad people) to reprise his role shooting promos for the second season of CBC’s
 Schitt’s Creek. As always, Matt delivered the goods.  I’m sure you’ve 
seen bits of these plastered ALL OVER Toronto ramping up to next week's 
season premier, but here they are in all of their glory!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1483378d09f4665d44e1849b7f2da35338411b29.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Jennifer Toole's photographs portray a brave nude world</h1><p>Jennifer Toole's photographs are sometimes captured in the first light of day. The soft glow of sunrise has long been a cherished time for photographers. But with Toole, it's more about cover for her "guerrilla-style" outdoor photo shoots, a safe time for her subjects to get naked.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff7817d2edcc03fe7a0c5ba910dafa36b9e40810.jpg"></article>]]></description>
